                    <h2>Combat-Pilot HUD Interface</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Intergrated Combat-Pilot Interface System is software that interacts directly with the HUD
                        of a pilots helmet.
                        <br> This provides smart, precise, and reactive data at a moments notice to assist in the pilots
                        decision making process via the HUD interface.
                        <br> The software is currently being tested and in hopes that it will make it to commercial use
                        on civilian aircraft wind shields
                        <br> where the same reactive information to a pilot can be displayed and easily interpritable.

                <p>
                    Airworthiness tracker is an app that allows aviation maintinance crews to keep track of scheduled
                    inspections and much more.
                    <br> Passdowns can now be shared in real time between maintainers aswell as live maintenance actions
                    on aircraft
                    <br> being worked on. Future inspections are readily displayable and active tool tracking enabled
                    for ensuring
                    <br> operational success.
